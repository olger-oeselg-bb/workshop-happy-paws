Please summarize the previous work completed, and then — acting as a Senior Software Engineer continue implementing the project.

Your work should follow the tickets and project documentation as outlined below.

Reference Documents:

- TICKETS.md - Current tasks and subtasks to implement  
- PLAN.md - Overall implementation plan and roadmap  
- ARCHITECTURE.md - System architecture, technical decisions, and dependencies  

These documents contain all vital information about the application you are building — including scope, data model, API design, and non-functional requirements.

Workflow Instructions:

1. Before each phase:
   - Create a **new feature branch** named after the phase (e.g., `feature/<phase-name>`).

2. During each phase:
   - Implement the features and changes described in the corresponding tickets.
   - Follow all coding standards, conventions, and practices defined in project documentation.
   - Ensure tests pass and code adheres to architecture and design principles.

3. After each subtask/ticket:
   - Commit your changes with a clear and descriptive commit message.
   - Mark the corresponding ticket as Done in TICKETS.md.

4. After completing the entire phase:
   - Present a summary of changes and show the updated files.
   - Wait for manual review and approval before continuing to the next phase.
