# Frontend Refactor Plan — Vue 3 + Pinia + Vite Migration

## Overview
This document outlines the phased migration of the Happy Paws prototype frontend from a monolithic vanilla JavaScript app (`static/app.js`) to a modern Vue 3 + Pinia + Vite stack. The refactor aims to improve maintainability, scalability, and developer experience while preserving all existing functionality and accessibility enhancements.

**Goal:** Deliver a component-based, reactive frontend that integrates seamlessly with the existing Express backend, enabling easier feature additions and testing.

**Scope:** Migrate the entire frontend codebase without disrupting the backend API or existing E2E tests. The new stack will live alongside the legacy code initially, with a gradual cutover.

**Timeline:** 4-6 weeks (assuming 1-2 developers), broken into 4 phases with weekly milestones.

**Success Criteria:**
- All user stories (US-001 to US-011) remain functional.
- No regressions in accessibility or performance.
- New codebase achieves 80%+ unit test coverage for components.
- Build and deploy process updated to use Vite.

## Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1: Planning & Setup (Current — FE-TECH-001 to FE-TECH-003)
- **Duration:** 1 week
- **Tickets:** FE-TECH-001, FE-TECH-002, FE-TECH-003
- **Deliverables:**
  - This plan document.
  - Vite environment configured in `frontend/` workspace.
  - Basic Pinia stores scaffolded for pets and UI state.
- **Milestones:** Vite dev server running with a placeholder "Hello World" component.

### Phase 2: Core Components & Routing (FE-TECH-004 to FE-TECH-008)
- **Duration:** 2 weeks
- **Tickets:** FE-TECH-004 to FE-TECH-008
- **Deliverables:**
  - Vue Router configured with routes for `/`, `/add`, `/pet/:id`.
  - `<AppShell>`, `<PetList>`, `<PetFilters>`, `<PetCard>`, `<AddPetForm>` components extracted.
  - Pinia stores fully wired for data loading and mutations.
- **Milestones:** All list and add views functional in Vue; backend integration tested.

### Phase 3: Advanced Features & Modules (FE-TECH-009 to FE-TECH-013)
- **Duration:** 2 weeks
- **Tickets:** FE-TECH-009 to FE-TECH-013
- **Deliverables:**
  - `<PetProfile>` with medical records and audit log modules.
  - API service layer (`src/api/`) for centralized HTTP calls.
  - UI feedback store for toasts and modals.
- **Milestones:** Profile view, medical CRUD, and photo gallery implemented; E2E tests updated if needed.

### Phase 4: Testing, Docs, & Cutover (FE-TECH-014 to FE-TECH-017, FE-TEST-001, FE-DOC-001/002)
- **Duration:** 1-2 weeks
- **Tickets:** FE-TECH-014 to FE-TECH-017, FE-TEST-001, FE-DOC-001/002
- **Deliverables:**
  - Unit tests with Vitest for key components.
  - Accessibility audit and fixes.
  - Updated `ARCHITECTURE.md` and retrospective doc.
  - Legacy `static/app.js` retired; Vite build integrated into Express.
- **Milestones:** Full parity with legacy app; CI updated; production deploy tested.

---

## Dependencies & Prerequisites
- **Team:** 1-2 frontend developers familiar with Vue 3, Pinia, and Vite.
- **Tools:** Node.js 18+, npm workspaces for monorepo setup.
- **Backend:** Existing Express API must remain stable; no changes to `/api/*` endpoints.
- **Testing:** Playwright E2E tests will validate end-to-end; new unit tests added incrementally.
- **Stakeholders:** QE team for test alignment; BA for UX sign-off.

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Vue learning curve slows progress | Medium | High | Schedule 1-2 days for team training; pair programming on early components. |
| Pinia state management introduces bugs | Low | Medium | Start with simple stores; add comprehensive unit tests early. |
| Accessibility regressions | Medium | High | Run axe-core audits after each phase; involve QE for manual testing. |
| Vite build integration fails with Express | Low | Medium | Prototype build output serving in Phase 1; have rollback to legacy app. |
| Scope creep (e.g., adding TypeScript) | High | Medium | Stick to plan; defer optional items like FE-TECH-017 to post-migration. |
| Backend API changes during refactor | Low | High | Freeze API during migration; communicate with backend team. |

**Risk Log Updates:** Reviewed weekly in standups; escalate if any risk moves to High probability/impact.

## Rollback Strategy
- **Phase-Level Rollback:** Each phase commits are isolated; can revert branch if issues arise.
- **Full Rollback:** If cutover fails, revert to `main` pre-migration and serve legacy `static/app.js`.
- **Partial Rollback:** Keep both apps deployable; use feature flag in Express to switch frontend sources.
- **Data Safety:** No database changes; frontend-only refactor.

**Rollback Steps:**
1. Checkout `main` branch.
2. If needed, `git revert` the merge commit of the refactor branch.
3. Update Express to serve `static/` instead of `dist/`.
4. Notify team and document lessons learned.
